                            In Canada, deposit insurance is a government-backed program that protects eligible deposits held at financial institutions in the event of insolvency. The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) is a federal agency that provides deposit insurance for eligible deposits up to $100,000 per insured category, per member institution.

                            In addition to CDIC, some provinces in Canada have their own deposit insurance programs. These programs provide additional deposit protection and most of them offer unlimited deposit insurance. For more information, please read our knowledge base.
