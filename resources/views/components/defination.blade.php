        <h5 class='font-weight-bold'>Redeemable:</h5>

        <p class='font-weight-light'>
            A redeemable deposit is a type of savings account where you deposit money with a bank or credit union for a set period of time in exchange for a fixed amount of interest. You can take out your money at any time without any penalty, and the interest rate is usually higher than a regular savings account. It's a good option for people who want to earn more interest on their savings but still want easy access to their money.

        <h5 class='font-weight-bold'>Non-Redeemable</h5>

        <p class='font-weight-light'>
            A non-redeemable term is a type of investment where you deposit money with a financial institution for a fixed period of time, during which you cannot withdraw your funds without incurring a penalty. The interest rate for the duration of the term is fixed and guaranteed. Non-redeemable terms are similar to a savings account, but with a set time frame and a higher interest rate. They are ideal for people who want to earn a higher interest rate on their savings and don't need to access their money in the short term. However, it's important to consider the length of the term and the penalty for early withdrawal before investing your money.

        <h5 class='font-weight-bold'>Cashable:</h5>

        <p class='font-weight-light'>
            A cashable deposit is a type of savings account that allows you to withdraw your money at any time without penalties. However, some cashable deposits may have a lock-out period (30 days, 60 days etc.), during which you cannot withdraw your funds or may be charged a penalty if you do. Despite this, cashable deposits are still a good option for people who want to earn interest on their savings while having easy access to their money, especially in case of emergencies. It's important to read the terms and conditions of the cashable deposit to understand any lock-out periods or penalties.

        <h5 class='font-weight-bold'>High Interest Savings Account:</h5>

        <p class='font-weight-light'>
            A high interest savings account is a type of savings account that pays a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. They are a good option for people who want to earn more interest on their savings while still having easy access to their money. However, high interest savings accounts may have limitations, such as transaction fees or restrictions on the number of withdrawals you can make per month. It's important to compare different high interest savings accounts and read the terms and conditions before opening an account.

        <h5 class='font-weight-bold'>Notice Deposit:</h5>

        <p class='font-weight-light'>
            A notice deposit is a type of savings account that requires you to give notice before you withdraw your money. This means that you cannot access your funds immediately, but rather have to give a notice period, usually ranging from 30 to 90 days, before withdrawing. Notice deposits typically offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts but lower than term deposits. They are a good option for people who want to earn interest on their savings but do not need immediate access to their funds. It's important to read the terms and conditions of the notice deposit to understand the notice period required and any penalties for early withdrawals.
