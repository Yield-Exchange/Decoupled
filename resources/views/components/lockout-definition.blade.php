                            A lock-out period is a specific period of time during which you cannot access your money or withdraw funds from an account. It is used to discourage early withdrawals, and if you try to withdraw funds before the end of the lock-out period, you may face penalties or fees. The length of the lock-out period can vary depending on the type of account or investment.
