                            The term length of a deposit refers to the length of time that an investor agrees to deposit their money with a financial institution. This period can vary from a short time, such as a day, to several years. At the end of the term, the investor can choose to withdraw their initial deposit plus any earned interest, or renew the deposit for another term.
